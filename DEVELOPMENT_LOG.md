## 2025-06-16 - Project Assessment & Logging Setup

### Session Start: Current Time
**Goals for Today:**
- Assess current project state vs planned architecture
- Implement development logging system
- Set up daily workflow tracking

### Current Project State Analysis
**‚úÖ What's Working:**
- Basic Electron app structure (main.js, package.json)
- HTML/CSS/JS frontend with comprehensive image loading
- Professional zoom/pan functionality in imageLoader.js
- Git repository initialized
- Comprehensive project documentation in claude_code_briefing.md

**‚ùå Current Gaps:**
- No React/TypeScript setup (despite briefing document specifying React)
- No dithering algorithms implemented yet
- Missing development workflow automation
- No logging system for tracking progress

**üîÑ Architecture Decision Needed:**
- Current: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS implementation
- Planned: React + TypeScript + Vite setup
- Evidence: `.ReactFormat` directory suggests React version was attempted but not completed

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Created structured DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md file
- [x] Analyzed current project architecture vs specifications
- [x] Documented working features and gaps

### Next Steps
- [ ] Create WORK_SESSION.md for real-time session tracking
- [ ] Add logging utilities to existing JavaScript code
- [ ] Decide on architecture path forward (vanilla JS vs React migration)
- [ ] Implement first dithering algorithm (Floyd-Steinberg)

### Technical Notes
- imageLoader.js at 499 lines is well-implemented with proper error handling
- Canvas-based image display system already supports zoom/pan operations
- File drag-drop and dialog systems are functional
- Project ready for dithering algorithm implementation

### Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge:** Architecture mismatch between current vanilla JS and planned React
**Solution:** Need to decide whether to continue with vanilla JS or migrate to React

**Challenge:** No development workflow tracking
**Solution:** Implementing logging system with session management

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start of Day:** Review previous session, set goals in WORK_SESSION.md
2. **During Work:** Log progress updates and discoveries
3. **End of Day:** Summarize accomplishments and set next session goals

### Commit Message Format
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix  
- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: testing changes
- chore: maintenance tasks

### File Reference Format
Use `file_path:line_number` when referencing code locations for easy navigation.

### Progress Tracking
- Daily sessions documented with timestamps
- Clear task completion tracking
- Technical discoveries and solutions recorded
- Architecture decisions documented with reasoning

# Active Work Session - Complete Dithering Suite

## Current Session: 2025-06-16 - Dithering Algorithm Implementation

### Session Start: 22:57:01
**Session Goal:** Implement Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm and integrate with existing image loader

---

## Session Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Implemented Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm (ditheringEngine.js - 280 lines)
- [x] Added Jarvis-Judice-Ninke and Atkinson algorithms
- [x] Created comprehensive dithering controls UI panel
- [x] Connected image loader to dithering system via events
- [x] Added real-time preview and processing indicators
- [x] Implemented export functionality for dithered images
- [x] Added CSS styling for all new controls

### üîÑ Currently Working On
- Session wrap-up and testing

### ‚è≥ Next Tasks
- Test the complete dithering functionality
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Implement additional dithering algorithms

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Today's Findings
- Successfully integrated dithering algorithms with existing image loader
- Custom event system works well for component communication
- Canvas-based image processing performs smoothly
- Three dithering algorithms implemented: Floyd-Steinberg, JJN, Atkinson

### Files Modified This Session
- `src/renderer/js/ditheringEngine.js` - New file (280 lines) - Core dithering algorithms
- `src/renderer/js/ditheringControls.js` - New file (220+ lines) - UI controls and events
- `src/renderer/index.html` - Added dithering control panel UI
- `src/renderer/styles/main.css` - Added 150+ lines of styling for controls
- `src/renderer/js/imageLoader.js` - Added event dispatch for image loading

### Code Quality Observations
- Excellent separation of concerns between engine, controls, and UI
- Comprehensive error handling and logging integration
- Professional UI styling with hover effects and disabled states
- Event-driven architecture allows for easy extension
